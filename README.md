## Overview

The frontend of Endangered, this project aims to educate, and to support conservation efforts focused on endangered animals.
Potential conservationaists can browse a list of some of earth's most prominent endgangered animals, with images and descriptions designed to help aid
in understanding. For those that want to help, this app also provides a list of charities that support conservation efforts for each animal.
A relatively simple app, Endangered became a fun way to practice Python/Django and TypeScript, while providing easy options for users to engage with the animals that most need support.

## Challenges

My primary challenge with endangered was to navigate the process of hosting and connecting a Python/Django backend to a TypeScript front end. I'd been wanting to practice both, and though there were some occasional surprises compared to the React/NodeJS I'm more used to, I enjoyed the process of getting the two working together.
